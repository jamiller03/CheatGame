# CheatGame

The card game Cheat is also known as BS. Cheat is a card game where the goal of the game is for a player to get rid of all of
their cards. If the player does not have the card they are supposed to put down on their turn, they can lie and put down the wrong card, however, they risk being called out and having to take all the cards in the pile. The purpose of the game was to determine what strategery is more likely to win: lying as often as possible or only lying when necessary.
